				<h3>Overview</h3>
		  		<p>In partnership with Orange Design and CNN, Blazing Cloud developed an interactive
		  		way to track the November elections with HTML and Javascript, specifically targeting
		  		the iPad. The election center map provided up to the minute election results
		  		through a color-coded interface. The map allowed users to choose which information they wished 
		  		to follow and drill down from national to county results.</p>
